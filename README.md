End of an Era Construct 2 Plugin
================================

This is my first attempt at a quadtree based Construct 2 plugin. It doesn't *actually* contain anything related to Constrcut 2 yet, but once I'm comfortable enough with Javascript I'm going to transfer it over. 

What This Plugin Does
---------------------

This plugin is supposed to control the terrain for my game. It's supposed to work a bit like terraria or worms, except that it uses a quadtree to store data.

I'm going to list some intended features here:
- [x] I actually have a renderring quadtree, yay!
- [ ] The current JSON Web Storage format is too big and needs to be reduced. Try IndexedDB. 
- [ ] I need to add support for multiple 'root' nodes controlled by a single object. 
- [ ] I need to add a system that will allow for loading and unloading of roots so I can have an "infinite" map. 



I'm probably going to change this plugin into something more generic later. Either that or I'm just going to give up on Construct 2 entirely. We'll see...
